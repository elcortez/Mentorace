            content: "A set can be defined as a collection, or a grouping of
              elements;
              \n there are two ways to define sets :
              <ol>
                <li>
                  by extension: write down all elements of the set between braces,
                  each element separated by a semicolon:
                  for instance R = { 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 }
                </li>
                <li>
                  by comprehension: write down the conditions under which an
                  element can be part of a set:

                  \n each element must be put between simple braces: -> (x − 1)
                  you put them one after the other -> (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4) = 0
                  \n and you define a number x that belongs (belonging symbol : ∈)
                  to a set R `such as` these conditions are respected.
                  \n The mathematical symbol for `such as` is written with the
                  pipe : |

                  \n { x ∈ R | (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4) = 0 }
                  \n the mathematical expression above can be read as the
                  following : `x belongs to the set R such as x - 1, or x - 2,
                  or x - 3, or x - 4 is equal to 0`
                  \n Therefore you can easily conclude that R is a set
                  that includes the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4
                </li>
              </ol>"

          example_1:
            content: "let E be the set that includes all even numbers below 10.
              E = { 2 ; 4 ; 6 ; 8 }
              \n or you can define E by comprehension:
              \n { x ∈ E | (x / 2 is an integer) AND (x <= 10) }"
          example_2:
            content: "let U be the set that includes all uneven numbers below 10.
              U = { 1 ; 3 ; 5 ; 7 ; 9 }
              \n or we can define U by comprehension:
              \n { x ∈ U | (x / 2 is not an integer) AND (x <= 10) }"

            question: "Let R be a set which can be defined as follows:
              \n { x ∈ R | (x >= 5) AND (x < 10) AND (x is an integer) }
              \n define R by extension"
            answer: "{ 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9 }"
          exercise_2:
            question: "Let S be a set which can be defined by extension as follows:
              \n S = { 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 }
              \n can S be also defined by comprehension as follows?
              \n { x ∈ S | (x <= 6) AND ((x + 1) > 6) }"
            answer: "false"
