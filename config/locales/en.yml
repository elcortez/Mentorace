    another_learning_platform: "Oh great, another learning platform…"
    it_is_different: "But this time, it’s different !"
    we_wanted_to_learn_too: "We wanted to learn too. We tried all these websites."
    we_went_through_every_mooc: "We went through every MOOC, every youtube tutorial,
      every wikipedia page, and every book to learn mathematics and computer science."
    and_it_hurt: "And man did it hurt."
    we_struggled: "We struggled with each of these classes, and hardly finished any."
    why_is_it_so_hard:
      question: "Why is it so hard to learn?"
      content_1: "Most of the MOOCS out there are either introductory, trading
        off depth for simplicity and a rapid overview of a topic that does not
        really teach you any professional skill…"
      content_2: "…. Or go straight into excruciatingly complex technical details
        that are simply out of reach for someone who has not already graduated
        on a similar topic"
      content_3: "Schools and universities already select the best young students
        and claim to be at the top of their game, when in fact the students they
        preselected were already the best before they passed through their doors"
      content_4: "Most of the time, you will get several pages of abstract theory
        thrown at your face without any example, or very few, and you will always
        have to come back to the same pages 10 times to finally understand one
        simple concept that could have been explained easily with just 2 or 3 examples."
    why_are_we_different:
      question: "Why are we different?"
      content_1: "First, we’re here to teach you a complete subject. You will
        not find mere « introductory courses » on this website. When we start
        something, we finish it. If you are here to learn mathematics for CS and
        algorithms, you will learn them fully, completely, from top to bottom,
        until you master the general concepts and every little detail."
      content_2: "We are professional oriented : these courses are designed to
        give you skills that you can use on the field of any business, as soon
        as you finished your learning"
      content_3: "We will take you to each step incrementally and carefully,
        decomposing every chunk of knowledge with a lot of practice, so that you
        never have to come back to the previous lesson to understand something.
        Our concept is very straightforward : 1 lesson, 5 exercices; and no
        lesson should take more than 15 minutes to read."
      content_4: "We will make you repeat the exercises several times on different
        situations. You will never leave a lesson without having practiced the
        concepts again and again, to make sure you really master the subject."
    many_teachers_believe: "Many teachers still believe that their job is merely
      to « transmit knowledge », and that it is up to the student to educated herself."
    we_believe: "We believe that someone who wants to learn something should just
      show up with her strong will and desire, and that it is up to the teacher
      to make sure that she learned properly."
    we_believe_2: "We believe in a world where anyone who desires to learn
      should have the ability to do so, regardless of their financial situation,
      or pre existing diplomas."
    if_you_believe: "If you believe in that too, then welcome aboard !
      You will embark in an amazing journey through the best classes out there,
      and leave with skills that you can use in the professional world."
    you_might_come_back: "And who knows, you might even come back here for fun !"
